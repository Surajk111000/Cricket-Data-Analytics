# Problem Statement

In the world of cricket, selecting the best playing eleven for a match is a critical decision that can significantly impact the outcome of the game. Traditionally, this decision has been based on subjective assessments and limited data analysis. The lack of a systematic approach to player selection can lead to suboptimal outcomes and missed opportunities.

To address this challenge, the project aims to leverage data-driven insights to enhance the process of selecting the final eleven players for a cricket match. The project involves a series of steps that encompass data collection, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization. By employing advanced data analytics techniques, the project seeks to provide a more objective and informed approach to cricket team selection.
The objective is to select the the best-playing 11 cricket team by performing analysis on T20 world cup 2022 data;

# Data Set Used
**Dataset Description:**

The dataset utilized in this project is a comprehensive collection of cricket player statistics obtained from the ESPN Cricinfo website. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of performance metrics for cricket players, including both batting and bowling statistics. The dataset is specifically curated to facilitate the data-driven approach to cricket team selection.

**Dataset Content:**

The dataset contains a multitude of attributes for each player, capturing their performance across various aspects of the game. The attributes include, but are not limited to:

- Batting Averages: The average number of runs a player scores per inning.
- Bowling Averages: The average number of runs conceded per wicket taken by a player.
- Strike Rates: The rate at which a player scores runs or takes wickets per ball faced or bowled.
- Runs Scored: The total number of runs scored by a player.
- Wickets Taken: The total number of wickets taken by a player.
- Batting and Bowling Styles: The preferred styles a player uses for batting and bowling.
- Player Experience: The number of matches a player has participated in.

**Dataset Preparation:**

The dataset undergoes several stages of preparation to ensure its suitability for analysis. These stages include:

1. **Web Scraping:** Data is collected using web scraping techniques from the ESPN Cricinfo website, capturing player statistics from various matches and tournaments.
2. **Data Cleaning:** The collected data is cleaned to rectify inconsistencies, missing values, and erroneous entries.
3. **Data Transformation:** The dataset is transformed to a structured format, enabling efficient analysis and integration.
4. **Data Modeling:** Relationships between data tables are established, and calculated measures and parameters are defined using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).

**Dataset Utilization:**

The dataset serves as the foundation for the data-driven approach to cricket team selection. Through advanced analytics and visualization techniques, the dataset is used to derive insights into player performance trends, strengths, and weaknesses. These insights guide the process of selecting the final eleven players for a cricket match.

The utilization of this dataset in the project marks a significant departure from traditional subjective methods of player selection, enhancing decision-making through evidence-based analysis. The insights extracted from the dataset empower team management to make informed choices that optimize team composition and performance in the competitive realm of cricket.
